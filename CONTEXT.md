# Bakalah

Bakalah is a personal Android reader fork derived from Mihon. This context captures project-specific language for distinguishing the personal fork from upstream Mihon.

## Language

**Personal App Identity**:
The complete public identity that makes Bakalah behave as a distinct app from upstream Mihon on a user's device and in app integrations.
_Avoid_: Package rename, rebrand, app id change

**Bakalah-Owned Link**:
A deep link whose scheme names Bakalah directly and is intended to open Bakalah without competing with upstream Mihon link ownership.
_Avoid_: Custom link, fork link

**Upstream Compatibility Link**:
A deep link originally owned by Mihon or Tachiyomi that Bakalah may still handle for compatibility with existing extension-store links or tracker redirects.
_Avoid_: Legacy link, old link

**User-Facing Branding**:
Names, text, icons, and release artifacts that identify the installed app to a person using or installing Bakalah.
_Avoid_: Internal package name, namespace

**Internal Namespace**:
Source code package names and module identifiers inherited from Mihon or Tachiyomi that do not by themselves determine Android install identity.
_Avoid_: App identity, launcher name
